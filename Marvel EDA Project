This project explores interactions between Marvel characters across different comics, using data visualization and network analysis techniques.

Data Cleaning:
Missing Values: Checked for and handled missing values by dropping rows with missing data.
Duplicates: Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Character Interaction Distribution:

Interaction Counting: Counted the number of interactions (appearances) for each Marvel character in the dataset.
Visualization: Plotted the top 10 Marvel characters by the number of comic appearances using a bar chart to illustrate the most prominent characters.
Network Analysis:

Graph Creation: Generated a graph of character interactions using NetworkX and Pyvis.
Network Visualization: Created an interactive network visualization to show connections between characters and comics. Nodes represent characters and comics, with customized properties for better clarity.
Heatmap Visualization:

Top Characters and Comics: Focused on the top 100 characters and comics based on interaction counts.
Interaction Matrix: Constructed an interaction matrix and visualized it using a heatmap to show the intensity of interactions between the top characters and comics.
This project highlights the use of data cleaning, network analysis, and advanced visualization techniques to analyze and visualize the interactions between Marvel characters.
